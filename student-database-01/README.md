Simple Student Database Management System with c++ and mysql
==================================

This project implements a Student Database Management System (DBMS) using C++, MySQL, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, Multi-threading, and Encryption/Decryption techniques. The system provides functionality to manage student records, including adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student data, while maintaining security and robustness in managing sensitive information.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   C++ Programming Language
*   MySQL (Relational Database Management System)
*   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*   Data Structures
*   Multi-threading
*   Encryption/Decryption

Features
--------

*   Store student data securely in MySQL database
*   CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records
*   User authentication and access control
*   Encryption and decryption for sensitive information
*   Multi-threaded processing for enhanced performance

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You need to install the following dependencies:

*   **MySQL Server:** Ensure that MySQL server is installed and running on your system.
*   **MySQL Connector/C++:** This library is required to connect C++ code to the MySQL database.
*   **OpenSSL:** For encryption and decryption functionalities.

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

    
    # Update the package list and install required dependencies
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libmysqlcppconn-dev libssl-dev
    
    # Install MySQL server (if not installed already)
    sudo apt install mysql-server
    
    # Optionally, verify MySQL server installation
    sudo service mysql status
    

#### For macOS

    
    # Install MySQL Connector/C++ and OpenSSL using Homebrew
    brew install mysql-connector-c++
    brew install openssl
    

#### For Windows

1\. Download MySQL Connector/C++ from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/).

2\. Follow the installation instructions for Windows to install the MySQL Connector/C++.

3\. Install OpenSSL if required.

### Step 2: Set Up MySQL Database

Create a database and a table to store student records. You can do this by running the following SQL queries:

    
    CREATE DATABASE student_db;
    
    USE student_db;
    
    CREATE TABLE students (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        age INT,
        gender VARCHAR(10),
        email VARCHAR(100),
        address TEXT
    );
    

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection in Code

Edit the C++ source code to provide the correct MySQL server details. Update the \`username\`, \`password\`, and \`database\` connection parameters in the following part of the code:

    
    sql::mysql::MySQL_Driver *driver;
    sql::Connection *con;
    
    driver = sql::mysql::get_mysql_driver_instance();
    con = driver->connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:3306", "your_mysql_username", "your_mysql_password");
    con->setSchema("student_db");
    

Replace \`"your\_mysql\_username"\` and \`"your\_mysql\_password"\` with your actual MySQL credentials.

### Step 4: Compile and Build the C++ Code

Once the dependencies are installed and the MySQL database is set up, you can compile and run the C++ code. Here's how to do it:

#### For Linux/macOS

    
    # Compile the C++ program using g++
    g++ -o student-database student-database.cpp -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlcppconn -lssl -lcrypto
    
    # Run the compiled program
    ./student-database
    

#### For Windows

Use an IDE like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks to configure the project and link to the necessary libraries:

*   Link to the MySQL Connector/C++ library
*   Link to OpenSSL libraries if you're using encryption features
*   Compile and run the project from your IDE

Usage
-----

Once the program is running, the system will allow you to perform CRUD operations on student records. Below is a list of operations:

*   **Add Student:** Add a new student record to the database.
*   **View Students:** View all student records stored in the database.
*   **Update Student:** Modify an existing student's data.
*   **Delete Student:** Remove a student record from the database.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

The system includes encryption and decryption for storing sensitive information such as passwords and personal details. Ensure that you set up proper SSL/TLS connections to the MySQL database for secure data transfer.
