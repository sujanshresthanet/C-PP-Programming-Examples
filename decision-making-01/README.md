This program provides an interactive menu with various C++ exercises related to decision-making and loops. The program is color-coded for better readability and user experience.

Features
--------

*   Check if a number is odd or even.
*   Check if an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.
*   Check if a year is a leap year.
*   Generate a multiplication table for a given number.
*   Display characters from 'A' to 'Z' using a loop.
*   Color-coded input and output for better user experience.
*   Interactive menu with continuous execution until the exit option is selected.

Code Details
------------

The program is written in **C++** and uses **ANSI escape codes** to add color to the console output. It features a menu-driven structure and handles various user inputs interactively.

### Menu Options

1.  Check if a number is odd or even.
2.  Check if an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.
3.  Check if a year is a leap year.
4.  Generate a multiplication table for a number.
5.  Display characters from 'A' to 'Z'.
6.  Exit the program.

How to Run
----------

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the code and save it in a file named `decision-making.cpp`.
2.  **Install a C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or an IDE like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
3.  **Compile the Program:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    
    g++ decision-making.cpp -o decision-making
                
    
4.  **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled file with the following command:
    
    ./decision-making
                
    
5.  **Interact with the Menu:** Choose an option from the menu and follow the on-screen instructions.

Example Execution
-----------------

When you run the program, you will see a colorful menu like this:

Select an option:
1. Check if a number is Odd or Even
2. Check if an alphabet is Vowel or Consonant
3. Check if a year is a Leap Year
4. Generate Multiplication Table
5. Display characters from 'A' to 'Z'
6. Exit
    

Select an option by entering its number and pressing `Enter`. Follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.

Requirements
------------

*   A terminal or IDE that supports ANSI escape codes for colored output.
