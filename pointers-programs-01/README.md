C++ Pointer Programs
====================

A collection of interactive C++ programs demonstrating pointer operations, complete with user-friendly options and colorful outputs.

Features
--------

*   Find the largest of three numbers using pointers
*   Count vowels and consonants in a string using a pointer
*   Print a string using a pointer
*   Swap two numbers using pointers
*   Initialize and access a pointer variable
*   Access array elements using a pointer

Getting Started
---------------

Follow these instructions to download, compile, and run the program on your local system.

### Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler like **g++** (part of GCC).
*   A terminal or command prompt supporting ANSI escape codes for colorful outputs.
*   Basic knowledge of how to run C++ programs.

### Installation

1.  Download or clone this repository to your local machine:
    
        git clone https://github.com/your-repository/pointer-programs.git
    
2.  Navigate to the downloaded directory:
    
        cd pointer-programs
    
3.  Ensure the `pointers-program.cpp` file is present.

How to Compile and Run
----------------------

Use the following steps to compile and execute the program:

1.  Open a terminal in the directory containing the `pointers-program.cpp` file.
2.  Compile the program using the **g++** compiler:
    
        g++ -o pointers-program pointers-program.cpp
    
3.  Run the compiled program:
    
        ./pointers-program
    
4.  Follow the on-screen menu to select and run the desired pointer operations.

Program Features
----------------

Each option in the menu corresponds to a specific pointer operation:

*   **Option 1:** Enter three numbers, and the program will find the largest using pointers.
*   **Option 2:** Enter a string to count the number of vowels and consonants using a pointer.
*   **Option 3:** Enter a string and display it using a pointer.
*   **Option 4:** Enter two numbers, and the program will swap them using pointers.
*   **Option 5:** Demonstrates initialization and access of a pointer variable.
*   **Option 6:** Access and display elements of an array using a pointer.
*   **Option 0:** Exit the program.

Error Handling
--------------

*   Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
*   Prompts the user to enter valid data without crashing.
*   Ensures the program can continue running after an error.

Example Output
--------------

Choose a program to execute:
1. Find the largest of three numbers using pointers
2. Count vowels and consonants in a string using a pointer
3. Print string using a pointer
4. Swap two numbers using pointers
5. Initialize and access a pointer variable
6. Access array elements using a pointer
0. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter three numbers: 10 20 15
The largest number is: 20
