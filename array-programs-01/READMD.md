Array Operations and Tic Tac Toe in C++
=======================================

This program provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations on arrays in C++ and includes a placeholder for a Tic Tac Toe game. Users can choose from the following options:

Features
--------

*   Sort an array in ascending order.
*   Find the largest element of an array.
*   Calculate the sum of array elements.
*   Count the number of elements in an array.
*   Calculate the average of array elements.
*   Tic Tac Toe game (to be implemented).
*   Swap the first and last elements of an array.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
*   A terminal or command-line interface

How to Run
----------

1.  Download the source code file: `array-programs.cpp`.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the file.
3.  Compile the program using the following command:
    
        g++ -o array-programs array-programs.cpp
