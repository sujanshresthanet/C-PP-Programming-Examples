Unit Conversion Program
=======================

Overview
--------

This is a unit conversion program written in C++. It allows users to convert various physical quantities such as length, temperature, area, volume, and weight between different units. The program supports continuous conversions, so users can keep converting until they decide to stop.

### Features:

*   **Length Conversion**: Convert between meters, kilometers, inches, feet, and millimeters.
*   **Temperature Conversion**: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
*   **Area Conversion**: Convert between square meters, square kilometers, square feet, acres, and square millimeters.
*   **Volume Conversion**: Convert between liters, cubic meters, gallons, cubic feet, and milliliters.
*   **Weight Conversion**: Convert between grams, kilograms, ounces, pounds, and milligrams.

Requirements
------------

*   **C++ Compiler** (such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
*   **Basic understanding of C++ and the terminal/command line**

**How to Run the Program
----------------------

### Step 1: Install a C++ Compiler

If you don't have a C++ compiler installed, you'll need to install one first:

*   For **Windows**: Install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
*   For **macOS**: You can install Xcode from the App Store, which includes a C++ compiler.
*   For **Linux**: Install GCC using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install g++` on Ubuntu).

### Step 2: Compile the Code

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where the `.cpp` file is located.
3.  Run the following command to compile the program:

    g++ -o conversions conversions.cpp

This will create an executable file called `conversions` (or `conversions.exe` on Windows).

### Step 3: Run the Program

To run the compiled program, use the following command:

    ./conversions  # On Linux/macOS

    conversions.exe  # On Windows

### Step 4: Use the Program

1.  The program will ask you to select the type of conversion you want to perform (e.g., Length, Temperature, etc.).
2.  After selecting a category, you will need to input the value and the units for the conversion.
3.  The program will display the converted result.
4.  You will be asked if you want to perform another conversion. Type `Y` or `y` to continue, or any other key to exit.

Example Usage:
--------------

    
    Select Conversion Category:
    1. Length
    2. Temperature
    3. Area
    4. Volume
    5. Weight
    
    Enter your choice (1-5): 1
    Select Length Units:
    1. Meters
    2. Kilometers
    3. Inches**
