Number Programs in C++
======================

This program is a collection of various number-related operations implemented in C++. It provides a menu-driven interface where the user can select an operation, input necessary values, and view the results. The program is designed to be modular and uses colorful terminal outputs for better readability.

Features
--------

*   Modular design with separate functions for each operation.
*   Color-coded menu options, inputs, and outputs using ANSI escape codes.
*   Handles various number-related operations such as GCD, LCM, checking prime numbers, etc.
*   Interactive menu with 16 different options.

Menu Options
------------

*   Add two integers
*   Find GCD of two numbers
*   Find LCM of two numbers
*   Check whether a number is prime
*   Count the number of digits in an integer
*   Calculate the power of a number
*   Print prime numbers from 1 to N
*   Display Armstrong numbers between two intervals
*   Check if a number is divisible by 3 and 5
*   Print numbers divisible by 3 and 5 from 1 to 100
*   Check abundant numbers
*   Find the sum of digits of a number
*   Display factors of a number
*   Swap first and last digits of a number
*   Print cubes of numbers up to a given integer
*   Exit the program

How to Run
----------

Follow these steps to run the program:

1.  Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
2.  Copy the program's source code into a file named `number-programs.cpp`.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4.  Compile the program using the following command:

    g++ -o number-programs number-programs.cpp

6.  Run the compiled program using the command:

    ./number-programs

8.  Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation from the menu.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
*   Terminal or command prompt with ANSI color support for colorful output.
*   Basic knowledge of navigating directories and compiling C++ code.

Notes
-----

*   Ensure your terminal supports ANSI color codes for the best experience. Most modern terminals (Linux, macOS, and Windows Terminal) support this.
*   The program is designed for educational purposes and includes basic input validation.
*   Feel free to modify the source code to add more features or enhance the menu options.

Example
-------

Here's an example of running the program:

        Choose an option from the following menu:
        1. Add two integers
        2. Find GCD of two numbers
        ...
        Enter your choice: 1
        Enter two integers: 5 10
        Sum: 15
